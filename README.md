Team: Lima 

A Cambridge CS Part 1B Project

## Dependencies
Make sure to have SuperCollider from https://supercollider.github.io/downloads.html installed, or the program will not run! The program is built off of there excellent platform.

## Description
A visual "old-school synth" style graphical interface for the SuperCollider language.

Project Brief:

Sophisticated digital music composition tools like the Sonic Pi language rely on an internal architecture of samples, waveforms and filters. In the popular SuperCollider system, a new synthesiser is defined by software-wiring together these "UGens‚Äù. Your task is to create a SuperCollider client that looks like a retro-style modular synthesiser or guitar pedal board, where connecting literal wires between pictures of hardware modules on the screen will construct an exact digital equivalent within the SuperCollider server. A live audio input would give you a universal guitar pedal, sample mixing makes you a DJ/producer, or if bleeps and whooshes are your thing, you can impress your Grandpa by channelling Brian Eno in the glory days of Roxy Music.
